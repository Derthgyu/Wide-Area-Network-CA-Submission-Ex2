1. Traffic Differentiation
Interpretation

Create two traffic classes:
	• Class 1 (VoIP-like) → small, frequent packets
	• Class 2 (FTP-like) → large, bursty packets

 Explanation 

This exercise focuses on Quality of Service (QoS) in a WAN network. The goal is to manage different types of traffic so that important traffic (such as voice or video) is treated with higher priority than less critical traffic (such as file downloads).

In this exercise, the network carries multiple traffic types at the same time. Without QoS, all packets are treated equally, which can cause delays and packet loss for time-sensitive applications during congestion. By introducing QoS mechanisms, the network is configured to prioritize delay-sensitive traffic, ensuring smoother communication and better performance.

This exercise highlights how QoS helps maintain service quality during heavy network usage and why traffic classification and prioritization are essential in real-world networks.

Code:
echoClientVoip.SetAttribute("PacketSize", UintegerValue(160));
echoClientVoip.SetAttribute("Interval", TimeValue(MilliSeconds(20)));
echoClientData.SetAttribute("PacketSize", UintegerValue(1500));
echoClientData.SetAttribute("Interval", TimeValue(MilliSeconds(5)));

2. Queue Management
Interpretation

Prioritize VoIP traffic using priority queueing.

Code:

TrafficControlHelper tch;
tch.SetRootQueueDisc("ns3::PriorityQueueDisc");
tch.Install(devices);

3. Performance Measurement
Metrics:
  • Delay
  • Jitter
  • Packet loss
  • Throughput

Tool:
FlowMonitorHelper fm;
fm.InstallAll();

4. Congestion Scenario
Interpretation:

Create congestion by sending traffic above 5 Mbps.

Code :
onoff.SetAttribute("DataRate", StringValue("20Mbps"));

Expected Result:
	• Without QoS → VoIP delay increases
	• With QoS → VoIP remains stable

5. Real-World QoS Gap
Hard to simulate accurately:
	• Hardware shaping
	• Deep packet inspection
	• ASIC-based scheduling

Approximation: queue disciplines + FlowMonitor.
